# ROSS - Rad Operating System
Small project on the raspberry pi 4 to teach myself about OS stuff and satisfy my desire to understand how things work.
Also I like low level stuff...

Notes:
* build with make
* sdcard in /tools contains:
  * updated armstubs so the CPU will boot in EL3
  * small bootloader that allows booting the actual kernel via UART
